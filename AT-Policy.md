## Purpose

Provide training in modern security practices, ensure announcements regarding new risks to information systems circulate immediately, and facilitate collaboration across Bixal Solutions and its client services to develop new technologies or methodologies to manage risk.

## Scope

See the [Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

In addition, the Bixal Solutions Information Security will coordinate with Bixal Solutions
client services as needed.

## Procedures

All Bixal Solutions employees undergo a
[Security Awareness training](https://learning.bixal.com) that includes the
[Acceptable Use Policy @todo handbook link](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/security/#acceptable-use-policy)
and the required use of a password manager and two factor authentication for access to
restricted resources.

If Bixal Solutions staff fail to comply with Bixal Solutions security awareness and training
requirements, their access to Bixal Solutions information systems may be terminated.

See AT-2.

Bixal Solutions Operations staff with significant information system security roles may be
required to complete role-based security-related training before being granted access, and
undergo subsequent refresher training annually.

Whenever a new person joins the Bixal Solutions team, they are assigned a Trello board
documenting a checklist of required training materials. The same process is applied to
each team member annually as if they were a new team member.

See AT-3, AT-4.
