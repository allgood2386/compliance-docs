# Systems and Communications Protection Policy

Bixal Solutions develops, documents, and disseminates secure system and communications
protection practices that may cover one or more controls within these families:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit and Accountability (AU)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)

## Purpose

Create information systems with the most sophisticated, strongest, and reasonable
cryptographic methodologies available. Structure networks with the lowest amount of access
and trust possible. Ensure communication channels fail into "closed states" if the
confidentiality or integrity of the communication channel is disrupted.

## Scope

See the [Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

Only privileged Bixal Solutions team roles (such as System Owner and Operations) have privileged access.

See SC-2.

Bixal Solutions generates customer-specific least-privilege credentials which are restricted
to reading and writing only data in shared resources belonging to that customer.

See SC-4.

When applicable, Bixal Solutions uses well-formed firewall rules to reduce the attack surface
of hosted components.

See SC-5, SC-6.

Bixal Solutions Operations team members configure client boundary protections and limits the
number of external network connections.

See SC-7.
