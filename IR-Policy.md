# Incident response

See the [Bixal Solutions Security Training](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-welcome-to-Bixal Solutions/training/security-training/) which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Contingency Planning (CP)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

## Purpose

Iteratively reduce both the number of incidents as a proportion of our total information system inventory, and reduce the mean time to recover from incidents.

## Scope

See the [Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

The Bixal Solutions Security Office organizes incident response training sessions, offered to the whole Bixal Solutions team at least annually, and requires that all Bixal Solutions Operations team members take the training. The training may be led by a Project Manager or a Security or Operations team member.

The Bixal Solutions team [Onboarding Process](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/08-hr-admin/onboarding-process/onboarding-process/) New Hire Checklist requires that all team members take incident response training within 30 days of joining the team. The training includes a quiz that requires an understanding of the procedures.

If the Bixal Solutions systems or processes change in a radical way, Bixal Solutions Security adapts the incident response training to meet the needs of the new system. Bixal Solutions Security then requires all Bixal Solutions team members to take the training again.

Bixal Solutions Security requires all Bixal Solutions team members to take the incident response training at least once a year.

See IR-2.

Bixal Solutions implements processes to detect and analyze malicious activity within the system platforms. If these processes detect malicious activity, they report the activity to the Operations team.

Bixal Solutions has an [Incident Response Plan](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan/) that documents the procedures that staff should take in the case of an incident.

See IR-4, IR-5, IR-6.

The Operations team implements automated processes such as ClamAV and AIDE to detect anomalies. When these processes detect an anomaly, they escalate an alert to Security Operations team members, often automatically via Slack and/or OpsGenie.

Bixal Solutions' systems automatically store logs so that Operations can access relevant information when investigating a potential incident.

See IR-4 (1), IR-6 (1).

As described in the Bixal Solutions security incident response guide and contingency plan, Operations will notify customers about incidents and potential incidents.

See IR-7.

Bixal Solutions Security has developed an [Incident Response Plan](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan/) to implement incident response capabilities.

The Incident Response Plan is continually reviewed and updated by the Bixal Solutions team. In addition, the Bixal Solutions team updates the IR Guide after it tests the guide, which happens at least annually and after any major system/organizational changes.

The Bixal Solutions team distributes changes to the Incident Response Guide to the whole Bixal Solutions team.

See IR-8.

Bixal Solutions Incident Response directs Bixal Solutions team members to watch out for and immediately report any potential security incident, which includes reporting suspected information spills (such as sensitive or classified information in the wrong places). In the event of a suspected information spill, Bixal Solutions team members follow the reporting process in the Bixal Solutions Incident Response Plan.

The System Owner, Program Manager, and Bixal Solutions Information Security and Technology team members have primary responsibility for implementing the actual response to security incidents, including technical measures.

See IR-9.
