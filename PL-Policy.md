# Security Planning Policy

Bixal Solutions maintains security policies for those clients that require it either by
contract, regulation or law. Such policy may cover one or more controls within these
families:

* Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments (CA)
* Planning (PL)
* Program Management (PM)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* System and Services Acquisition (SA)

## Purpose

Create system security plans, diagrams, rules, privacy impact assessments, and operational
procedures that are easy to understand, enforce, implement, and that reduce complexity
wherever it can be found.

## Scope

See the [Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

Using the most current template applicable to the systems and services provided,
Bixal Solutions develops a system security plan which includes the hosting platform and
encompasses the provided applications.

When created, Bixal Solutions distributes copies of the security plan and communicates
subsequent changes to the plan to the System Owner, ISSO, ISSM, AO and other designated
members within the Bixal Solutions staff and client services.

The Information Security Officer reviews the SSP at least annually or whenever there is a
significant change to the information system.

The Information Security Officer updates the SSP to address changes to the platform and
its network of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security
control assessments, and thereafter whenever a significant change occurs.
