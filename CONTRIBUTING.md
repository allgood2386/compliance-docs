## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the Bixal Solutions Common Security Controls! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [Bixal Solutions Code of Conduct](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/code-of-conduct/) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [Bixal Solutions Handbook](https://Bixal Solutions-handbook.readthedocs.io), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:support@Bixal Solutions.com).
