# Identification and Authentication Policy

Bixal Solutions systems incorporate proper user identification and authentication
methodology.  In some cases, basic security policy controls may need to be modified or
supplemented in order to address application-specific or system-specific requirements.
Typically, the following operational control families are implemented and monitored by
personnel responsible for administering and operating a system, such as the network,
system, and application administrators, system and data owners, ISSOs, and custodians.

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit and Accountability (AU)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)

## Purpose
