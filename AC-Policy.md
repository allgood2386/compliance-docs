# Access Control Policy

Bixal Solutions develops, documents, and disseminates to all Bixal Solutions staff the Access
Control Policy which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, compliance, and procedures to
facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls.
The Bixal Solutions Access Control Policy is maintained in the Bixal Solutions Handbook @todo get link/artifact/permission to publish.

Bixal Solutions Information Security will review and update the Bixal Solutions Access Control
Policy at least every 3 years and any documented access procedures at least annually.

The Bixal Solutions Access Control Policy covers:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit and Accountability (AU)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)

## Purpose

Limit information system access to authorized users or processes acting on behalf of
authorized users. Enforce "least privilege" methodologies for all system actions.

## Scope

See the [Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[Bixal Solutions Common Control Policy](BixalSolutions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

In addition, the Bixal Solutions Information Security will coordinate with Bixal Solutions
client services as needed.

## Procedures

Bixal Solutions gives administrative user roles to employees only after review by
Bixal Solutions Information Security. Reviews of user access rights are performed on a
regular basis (at least twice annually). Employee access privileges are removed upon
termination of their relationship to the company.

HTTPS and Secure Shell (SSH) are used for remote access, and all remote access is documented,
monitored and controlled.

Access to client systems and services may be extended to include the provisioning of privileged
users by the client under the conditions of their Access Control Policy.

See AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-8, AC-14, AC-17

Bixal Solutions systems always adhere to the principle of role segmentation and least privilege
wherever possible.
